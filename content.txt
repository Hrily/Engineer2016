Chronus is a professionally organized event primarily aimed at entertaining the crowd. After the grinding competitions the event promises to be an exhilarating experience. Laser shows, pyrotechnics, laser man, 3D facade projection (from Russian professionals) are some of the shows we have hd so far. This year we are trying to take this show to the next level by attracting some relevant shows from abroad. Some ideas include stop-motion photography, "Feeding the fish" Pixel-Poi - technical juggling, and the like.

The brand will recieve huge national media attention, both pre and post Engineer because these shows have never been performed in India before.
